## ⚙️ Section 2: Scenario

**Scenario:**  
Your development team is building a new social media application that needs to handle user posts, comments, likes, and real-time notifications. The application should be able to scale to millions of users and handle traffic spikes during viral content moments. The team wants to use modern cloud-native approaches and ensure fast development cycles with frequent deployments.

Design a cloud architecture for this social media application. Consider:
- How would you structure the application (monolith vs microservices)?
- What types of databases would you use for different data types?
- How would you handle real-time features like notifications and live feeds?
- How would you ensure the application can scale automatically?
- What development and deployment practices would you recommend?

## 🧩 Section 3: Problem-Solving

**Task:**  
A startup wants to migrate their development workflow to the cloud. Currently, developers work on a monolithic application, manually deploy to servers, and there's no automated testing. They want to:
- Enable multiple developers to work simultaneously without conflicts
- Automatically test code changes
- Deploy multiple times per day safely
- Roll back quickly if issues occur
- Have separate environments for development, testing, and production

Design a cloud-based development workflow that addresses these requirements. Include:
- Version control and collaboration strategy
- Automated testing and quality assurance
- Deployment pipeline and environment management
- Monitoring and rollback procedures

2. Explain the concept of "immutable infrastructure" in cloud computing. [📖 Answer](mock_3_answers.md#2-explain-the-concept-of-immutable-infrastructure-in-cloud-computing)
3. What are the benefits and challenges of using managed database services vs. self-managed databases? [📖 Answer](mock_3_answers.md#3-what-are-the-benefits-and-challenges-of-using-managed-database-services-vs-self-managed-databases)
4. What is blue-green deployment and how does it work in cloud environments? [📖 Answer](mock_3_answers.md#4-what-is-blue-green-deployment-and-how-does-it-work-in-cloud-environments)
