## ⚙️ Section 2: Scenario

**Scenario:**  
Your company has successfully migrated a web application to the cloud. However, you're now receiving complaints from users about slow performance during peak hours, and your cloud bill is higher than expected. The application consists of web servers, a database, and serves static content like images and CSS files.

Describe the steps you would take to investigate and resolve both the performance issues and cost concerns. What cloud services and techniques would you consider implementing?
