## ⚙️ Section 2: Scenario

**Scenario:**  
A global e-learning platform is experiencing performance issues. Students from different continents report slow video loading times, and the application becomes unresponsive during peak hours (evening in different time zones). The platform stores course videos, student data, and handles real-time video conferencing. The current setup uses a single cloud region, and the database is experiencing high load during assessments when thousands of students submit answers simultaneously.

Design a solution to improve global performance and handle traffic spikes. Consider:
- How would you improve content delivery for global users?
- What strategies would you use to handle database load during peak times?
- How would you ensure the application remains available during regional outages?
- What monitoring would you implement to prevent future issues?
- How would you optimize costs while improving performance?

## 🧩 Section 3: Problem-Solving

**Task:**  
A financial services company needs to ensure their cloud infrastructure meets strict regulatory requirements. They handle sensitive financial data and must comply with regulations like SOX, PCI DSS, and regional data protection laws. They're concerned about:
- Data residency requirements (data must stay in specific countries)
- Audit trails for all system access and data changes
- Encryption of sensitive data at all times
- Regular security assessments and vulnerability management
- Business continuity and disaster recovery planning
- Vendor risk management for cloud services

Design a comprehensive cloud governance and compliance strategy. Include:
- How would you ensure data stays in required geographic regions?
- What controls would you implement for access management and audit trails?
- How would you handle encryption and key management?
- What disaster recovery strategy would meet regulatory requirements?
- How would you manage ongoing compliance monitoring and reporting?
