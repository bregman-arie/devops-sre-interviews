## üß† Section 1: Core Questions - Answers

### 1. What is cloud computing, and how does it differ from traditional on-premises infrastructure?

**Answer:** Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet ("the cloud") with pay-as-you-go pricing. Key differences from on-premises:
- **Ownership**: You don't own the physical hardware; cloud provider manages it
- **Scalability**: Near-instant scaling up/down vs. purchasing new hardware
- **Cost Model**: OpEx (operational expenses) vs. CapEx (capital expenses)
- **Maintenance**: Cloud provider handles hardware maintenance, updates, security patches
- **Accessibility**: Access from anywhere with internet vs. physical location dependency
- **Reliability**: Built-in redundancy and disaster recovery vs. single points of failure

### 2. Explain the three main cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Give examples of each.

**Answer:**
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. You manage OS, applications, and data.
  - Examples: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with infrastructure.
  - Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, Google App Engine, Heroku
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Complete software applications delivered over the internet.
  - Examples: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce, Slack, Zoom

### 3. What are the main types of cloud deployment models (public, private, hybrid)?

**Answer:**
- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations. Cost-effective, highly scalable.
  - Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated cloud environment for a single organization, either on-premises or hosted. Greater control and security.
  - Examples: VMware vSphere, OpenStack, AWS Outposts
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them. Provides flexibility and optimization.
  - Use cases: Keeping sensitive data in private cloud while using public cloud for scalable workloads

### 4. Which cloud services would you typically use for compute, storage, and networking in a major cloud provider?

**Answer:**

**AWS:**
- **Compute**: EC2 (virtual machines), Lambda (serverless), ECS/EKS (containers)
- **Storage**: S3 (object storage), EBS (block storage), EFS (file storage)
- **Networking**: VPC, Route 53 (DNS), CloudFront (CDN), Elastic Load Balancer

**Azure:**
- **Compute**: Virtual Machines, Azure Functions, Container Instances/AKS
- **Storage**: Blob Storage, Managed Disks, Azure Files
- **Networking**: Virtual Network, DNS, CDN, Load Balancer

**Google Cloud:**
- **Compute**: Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, GKE
- **Storage**: Cloud Storage, Persistent Disks, Cloud Filestore
- **Networking**: VPC, Cloud DNS, Cloud CDN, Cloud Load Balancing

### 5. What is the difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling in cloud environments?

**Answer:**
- **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to existing machines
  - Pros: Simple, no application changes needed
  - Cons: Limited by hardware limits, single point of failure, downtime during scaling
  - Example: Upgrading from t3.micro to t3.large EC2 instance

- **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**: Adding more machines to the resource pool
  - Pros: No upper limit, better fault tolerance, can scale elastically
  - Cons: Requires application design considerations, complexity in data consistency
  - Example: Adding more EC2 instances behind a load balancer

### 6. What are the key benefits of using cloud computing over traditional infrastructure?

**Answer:**
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use, no upfront hardware costs
- **Scalability**: Quickly scale resources up or down based on demand
- **Flexibility**: Access to latest technologies without hardware investments
- **Reliability**: Built-in redundancy, backup, and disaster recovery
- **Global Reach**: Deploy applications worldwide with minimal latency
- **Automatic Updates**: Provider handles security patches and software updates
- **Focus on Core Business**: Reduce time spent on infrastructure management
- **Faster Time to Market**: Rapid provisioning of resources

### 7. What is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and why would you use one?

**Answer:** A VPC is a private network within a public cloud environment that provides isolation and control over your cloud resources. Benefits:
- **Network Isolation**: Logically separate your resources from other customers
- **Security**: Control inbound/outbound traffic with security groups and NACLs
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data isolation
- **Custom Networking**: Define IP address ranges, subnets, route tables
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Connect to on-premises networks via VPN or direct connection
- **Multi-tier Architecture**: Separate public and private subnets for different tiers

### 8. Explain the concept of elasticity in cloud computing.

**Answer:** Elasticity is the ability to automatically provision and de-provision computing resources based on current demand. Key characteristics:
- **Automatic Scaling**: Resources scale up during high demand, down during low demand
- **Real-time**: Scaling happens quickly in response to metrics (CPU, memory, requests)
- **Cost Optimization**: Only pay for resources when needed
- **Performance**: Maintains application performance during traffic spikes
- **Examples**: Auto Scaling Groups (AWS), Virtual Machine Scale Sets (Azure), Managed Instance Groups (GCP)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Section 2: Scenario - Answer

**Migration Strategy:**

**Assessment Phase:**
1. **Current State Analysis**: Document existing application architecture, dependencies, performance requirements
2. **Cloud Readiness**: Evaluate application compatibility with cloud services
3. **Cost Analysis**: Compare current costs vs. projected cloud costs

**Migration Approach:**
1. **Lift and Shift**: Move to cloud VMs with minimal changes (fastest approach)
2. **Re-platform**: Use managed services (e.g., managed database, load balancers)
3. **Refactor**: Modernize application to use cloud-native services

**Recommended Services:**
- **Compute**: Virtual machines or containers for the application
- **Database**: Managed database service (RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure Database)
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances
- **Storage**: Object storage for static assets, block storage for application data
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Cloud Monitoring
- **Backup**: Automated backup solutions

**Key Considerations:**
- **Security**: Implement proper access controls, encryption, network security
- **High Availability**: Deploy across multiple availability zones
- **Disaster Recovery**: Implement backup and recovery procedures
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize based on cloud metrics
- **Cost Management**: Implement cost monitoring and optimization strategies
