## üß† Section 1: Core Questions

1. You operate a VM in Cloud Provider A whose attached block storage volumes are encrypted with a customer-managed key (not provider-default). You must move (not just application-level copy) that encrypted volume's data into Cloud Provider B, attach it to a new VM, and preserve confidentiality without ever exposing plaintext outside a controlled boundary. The destination must assume independent key control (new key hierarchy) and you must evidence integrity and minimal exposure. Describe an end-to-end plan covering: export / snapshot format choice, secure transfer channel or artifact escrow, temporary re-wrap vs full re-encryption, handling differing encryption primitives (e.g., AES-GCM vs XTS), IAM / key policy alignment, provenance & integrity attestation, secrets / key rotation timing, data remanence mitigation at source, rollback strategy, and risk controls for side-channel or metadata leakage.
