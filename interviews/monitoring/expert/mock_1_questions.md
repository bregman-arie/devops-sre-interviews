# Monitoring & Observability - Expert Interview Mock #1

> **Difficulty:** Expert  
> **Duration:** ~75 minutes  
> **Goal:** Assess ability to design autonomous observability ecosystems, predictive reliability controls, and org-wide telemetry governance.

## üß† Section 1: Core Questions

1. Engineer an autonomous observability control plane that dynamically adjusts sampling, retention, and alert rules based on error budget burn/state models.  
2. Describe a blueprint for organization-wide trace ID adoption across polyglot services (legacy + serverless + edge).  
3. How would you integrate eBPF-derived signals into traditional metrics/traces for kernel-level performance insights?  
4. Propose a methodology for quantifying MTTR improvements attributable to observability investments.  
5. Design a multi-layer security & privacy model for telemetry (redaction, encryption zones, access policy graph).  
6. Explain strategies for proactive incident prevention using correlation of weak signals (small latency drifts + cache churn).  
7. Outline change intelligence: automatic detection & attribution of performance shifts to specific deploys/config changes.  
8. What would a ‚Äútelemetry SLO‚Äù look like and how do you enforce it (freshness, completeness, cardinality bounds)?
