## üß† Section 1: Core Questions

1. How do you manage high-cardinality metrics in Prometheus or similar systems?  
2. Describe an approach to designing SLOs for a composite user journey spanning multiple microservices.  
3. Compare sampling strategies for distributed tracing (head vs tail vs adaptive).  
4. How would you design log retention and tiering balancing cost, compliance, and query performance?  
5. Explain strategies to correlate metrics, logs, and traces for faster root cause analysis.  
6. Discuss pros/cons of push vs pull metrics collection.  
7. What methods detect anomalies beyond static thresholds (e.g., seasonality-aware)?  
8. Define an alert review process to continuously reduce noise.
