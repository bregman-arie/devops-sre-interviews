## üß† Section 1: Core Questions

1. Architect a multi-tenant metrics system isolating noisy tenants; include rate limiting & quota enforcement.  
2. Describe real-time cardinality watchdog design and automatic label suppression.  
3. Compare statistical anomaly detection (Z-score) vs ML-based approaches (seasonal ARIMA) for metrics.  
4. How to implement span tail-based sampling triggered by error density or latency spikes.  
5. Design a schema evolution workflow for structured logs with versioning.  
6. Strategies for merging trace + profiling data for performance regression insights.  
7. Implement cost attribution of telemetry to teams; what data model?  
8. Discuss resilience patterns for the observability pipeline (queueing, circuit breakers, fallback telemetry).
