# Monitoring & Observability - Advanced Interview Mock #1

> **Difficulty:** Advanced  
> **Duration:** ~60 minutes  
> **Goal:** Assess capability to architect large-scale observability platforms, optimize telemetry cost, and enable predictive operations.

## 🧠 Section 1: Core Questions

1. Design a multi-region observability pipeline handling 10M metrics samples/sec + 50K spans/sec with <5s ingestion-to-query latency.  
2. Explain a strategy for adaptive alerting that integrates burn rates + anomaly detection + runbook automation.  
3. How do you enforce telemetry governance (PII scrubbing, schema evolution, field allowlists) at ingestion?  
4. Describe approaches to reduce telemetry cost by 30% without sacrificing investigatory power.  
5. Architect a tracing system that supports high-cardinality service graphs while maintaining query performance.  
6. Discuss techniques for trace-based performance regression detection pre-prod vs prod.  
7. Propose a design for unified service dependency mapping with real-time impact scoring.  
8. How do you measure observability maturity and drive roadmap prioritization?
