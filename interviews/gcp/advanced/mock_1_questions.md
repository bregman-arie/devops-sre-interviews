## ‚öôÔ∏è Section 2: Scenario

**Scenario:**  
You're the principal architect for a global financial services company migrating from a legacy mainframe system to GCP. The system processes millions of transactions daily across 15 countries with strict regulatory requirements (PCI DSS, SOX, regional data residency laws). The current system has 99.99% availability but lacks scalability.

Key requirements:
- **Global Scale**: Process transactions from Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Americas
- **Compliance**: Each region must maintain data sovereignty
- **Performance**: <100ms transaction processing, <50ms for fraud detection
- **Availability**: 99.995% SLA (26 minutes downtime per year)
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, audit trails, fraud detection
- **Disaster Recovery**: RPO <5 seconds, RTO <2 minutes

Design the complete architecture including:
- Multi-region deployment strategy with data placement
- Real-time fraud detection and transaction processing
- Compliance and audit framework
- Disaster recovery and business continuity
- Performance optimization and cost management

## üß© Section 3: Problem-Solving

**Task:**  
Design and implement a globally distributed, highly available trading platform with advanced multi-region failover capabilities. This system must handle:

**Business Requirements:**
- **Trading Volume**: 100,000+ transactions per second globally
- **Latency**: <10ms for trade execution, <1ms for market data
- **Availability**: 99.999% (5.26 minutes downtime per year)
- **Regions**: Primary (us-east1), Secondary (europe-west1), Tertiary (asia-northeast1)
- **Regulatory**: Real-time risk management, audit trails, circuit breakers

**Technical Challenges:**
- **Data Consistency**: Strong consistency for account balances, eventual consistency for market data
- **Failover Complexity**: Multi-level failover with automatic and manual triggers
- **Split-Brain Prevention**: Consensus algorithms for leader election
- **Cross-Region Latency**: Minimize impact on trading performance
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Region-specific data handling and reporting

**Advanced Requirements:**
1. **Intelligent Failover**: ML-based prediction of failures before they occur
2. **Partial Failover**: Granular failover (per-service, per-customer segment)
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain core functionality during degraded states
4. **Dynamic Topology**: Runtime reconfiguration of multi-region topology
5. **Chaos Engineering**: Built-in failure injection and testing

Design the architecture with:
- Global distributed database strategy (CAP theorem considerations)
- Advanced load balancing with latency-based routing
- Real-time monitoring and automated decision systems
- Comprehensive disaster recovery testing framework
- Performance optimization across global network paths
