## ⚙️ Section 2: Scenario

**Scenario:**  
Your organization currently runs a nightly batch warehouse (on-prem Teradata) feeding next-day dashboards. Leadership wants near real-time (≤2 min latency) operational analytics, ML feature freshness under 5 minutes, and governance alignment with PCI + regional residency. Existing applications produce a mixture of CDC database changes, transactional app events, and file drops (CSV). Future roadmap includes multi-cloud resilience and event-driven microservices.

Requirements:
- Incremental ingestion with schema evolution safety  
- Exactly-once semantics for core financial aggregates  
- Multi-region analytics with localized PII handling  
- ML feature store with backfill + streaming convergence  
- Central policy tagging and lineage  
- Cost guardrails & workload isolation  

Design the target streaming + batch unification architecture using GCP services. Explain ingestion, transformation layers, storage zones, feature store integration, governance enforcement, replay strategy, and cost controls.

## 🧩 Section 3: Problem-Solving

**Task:**  
You must design an orchestrated multi-wave upgrade system for 12 global GKE clusters (prod) running a service mesh. Constraints:
- Zero perceived downtime (error budget impact <0.05%)  
- Canary wave per region then parallel safe waves  
- Automatic rollback if latency >20% baseline or mTLS failure rate >1%  
- Audit trail & SLO impact report  
- Must upgrade both control plane and data plane (sidecars) with version skew policy (<2 versions)  

Provide the upgrade workflow, gating signals, automation components, and failure containment tactics.

## ⚙️ Section 2: Scenario

**Scenario:**  
You must design a real-time global multiplayer gaming backend (matchmaking + state synchronization + leaderboards) with:
- **Latency Targets:** p95 < 30ms regional; p99 < 45ms cross-region relay
- **Traffic:** 5 million concurrent players; spikes 3× within 2 minutes
- **Consistency:** Strong for transactional inventory/currency; eventual for presence/status; monotonic for leaderboard updates
- **Availability:** 99.99% (≤ 52m downtime/year)
- **Resilience:** Survive a full regional outage with < 120s impact and no player data loss
- **Security:** Prevent cheating/exploit replay; cryptographic session integrity; minimal data exfiltration risk

Design an end-to-end GCP architecture addressing:
1. Matchmaking latency and proximity routing
2. Real-time state fan-out (Pub/Sub vs WebSockets vs UDP gateways)
3. Data tier composition (Spanner, Bigtable, Memorystore, Firestore?)
4. Leaderboard freshness vs cost trade-offs
5. Cheat detection ML inference path (Vertex AI / custom accelerators)
6. Disaster recovery + session continuity
7. Observability: per-player latency heatmaps + tail spike early warning
8. Cost controls while keeping SLO headroom
