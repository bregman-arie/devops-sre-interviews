## üß† Section 1: Core Questions - Answers

### 1. Architect a hybrid multi-cloud ingress layer using Global External HTTP(S) Load Balancer + Cloud Armor + Cloud CDN that can fail traffic to an alternate cloud while preserving client affinity. What mechanisms enable health detection and state continuity?

**Pattern:** Global LB (anycast IP) ‚Üí backend services (primary GCP, standby external origin via external NEG / hybrid connectivity). Cloud Armor for WAF + rate limiting; Cloud CDN for edge caching static assets.

**Health & Failover:** Multi-region health checks (HTTP/gRPC) + synthetic probe Cloud Functions verifying deeper dependencies. External NEG referencing Hybrid Connectivity (Cloud Interconnect / VPN) to alternate cloud ingress. If primary backend 5xx/unhealthy threshold crossed, LB shifts weighting to secondary.

**State Continuity:** Stateless JWT sessions; sticky-affinity cookie only for short-lived flows. Shared global session/feature flags in Spanner or Memorystore replicated. Client-affinity after failover maintained via consistent hashing token (e.g., user ID mod region set). Edge cache keys include version to prevent mixing partially upgraded assets.

### 2. Explain how to build a low-latency feature store architecture supporting both streaming (‚â§2s) and historical batch backfill at 10+ TB/day using GCP services.

**Streaming Path:** Pub/Sub (events) ‚Üí Dataflow streaming (stateful aggregation, TTL windows) ‚Üí Vertex AI Feature Store (online store) + Bigtable (low-latency) for hot feature reads.

**Batch Backfill:** BigQuery (raw partitioned) ‚Üí Dataflow/BigQuery SQL transform ‚Üí bulk import to Feature Store offline store (BigQuery) + parallel Bigtable writes. Use checkpointed export shards.

**Convergence:** Periodic reconciliation job compares streaming state vs batch recompute; anomalies trigger state repair.

**Scalability:** Autoscaling Dataflow with Streaming Engine; per-feature family separate pipelines to isolate lag. Schema registry ensures forward-compatible field additions.

### 3. Design a unified policy enforcement model using Organization Policy, IAM Conditions, Policy Controller, and VPC Service Controls to prevent unauthorized copying of sensitive BigQuery datasets to external projects. Provide enforcement + detection flows.

**Enforcement Layers:**
1. Org Policy: Restrict resource locations + disable cross-project dataset copy for tagged projects (combined with custom Cloud Function guard if needed).  
2. VPC SC: Perimeter around sensitive projects stops data exfil via API to outside perimeter.  
3. IAM Conditions: Grant `bigquery.dataViewer` only if request.ip in corporate ranges & request.time < expiry.  
4. Policy Controller: Deny creation of datasets without required policy tags (sensitivity=confidential).  

**Detection:** Audit logs (BigQuery Data Access) exported to BigQuery; scheduled query detects large export jobs or COPY to non-whitelisted project; Pub/Sub alert ‚Üí Cloud Function triggers manual approval workflow for exception.

### 4. Compare Dataflow vs Flink-on-GKE vs Spark (Dataproc) for a pipeline requiring complex event-time joins, low watermark lag, and exactly-once semantics at 500K events/sec. Provide a selection rationale.

| Aspect | Dataflow | Flink on GKE | Spark (Structured Streaming) |
|--------|----------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Ops Overhead | Low (managed) | High (cluster mgmt) | Medium (Dataproc ephemeral) |
| Event-Time Joins | Strong (Beam API) | Strong | Moderate (joins cost, micro-batch) |
| Latency | Seconds to sub-second | Sub-second (tuned) | Micro-batch (higher) |
| Exactly-Once | Provided (idempotent sinks) | Provided (stateful) | Achievable with checkpointing |
| Scaling | Autoscaling workers | Manual / custom | Manual or autoscaling limited |
| Ecosystem | Beam portability | Rich Flink features | Spark ML integration |
**Rationale:** Dataflow preferred for managed scaling + watermark accuracy; Flink if requiring exotic window operators / custom state; Spark if heavy inline ML libs needed and latency tolerance higher.

### 5. Outline a blueprint for proactive SRE automation that uses burn-rate signals, change risk scores, and predictive saturation models to auto-throttle deployments across 30+ services. Which metrics and algorithms power this?

**Metrics:** Error budget burn (fast/slow windows), latency percentiles, CPU/memory headroom, queue backlog slope, recent deploy frequency, incident count, anomaly score.

**Algorithms:**
- Burn-rate thresholds (multi-window).  
- Time-series forecasting (Prophet) for saturation; if predicted breach < horizon, throttle.  
- Change risk scoring: logistic regression on past deploy metadata (lines changed, service criticality, on-call load).  
- Anomaly detection: Isolation Forest on combined latency/error features.

**Automation:** Cloud Deploy gating: if risk score + burn-rate exceed policy, shift to slower rollout or freeze. Notification with override (break-glass) logged.

### 6. Describe a secure analytical enclave pattern for regulated data (PCI + HIPAA) enabling ephemeral querying via isolated Vertex AI notebook sessions with auditable, hermetic execution.

**Pattern:** Request triggers provisioning of ephemeral Vertex AI Workbench instance inside restricted subnet (no public egress) + VPC SC perimeter. Access via IAP + short-lived IAM binding. Notebook environment built from signed container (Binary Authorization enforced). All storage mount read-only except designated scratch GCS bucket (CMEK). Session logs & executed cells captured to BigQuery audit dataset. Idle timeout (15m) auto-shutdown; secret access broker issues time-bound tokens. Data egress policies enforced by Org Policy & Firewall egress deny except internal APIs.

### 7. Engineer a dynamic cost-to-reliability optimization loop that tunes Cloud Run min instances, GKE node pool autoscaling parameters, and BigQuery slot reservations daily. What signals and control actions are applied?

**Signals:** P95 cold start latency, request burst factor, node pending pods %, BigQuery slot utilization %, query queue wait time, SLO error budget, cost per workload vs target.

**Control Actions:**
- Increase min instances for services breaching latency SLO due to cold starts; decrease where spare > threshold.  
- Adjust GKE node pool min/max; shift workloads to spot/preemptible pools if error budget healthy.  
- Reallocate slot reservations (ingest vs ad-hoc) based on prior day queue delays; purchase/release flex slots.  
- Produce daily diff report + apply via Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Functions automation (with rollback if SLA regression).  

### 8. Provide a hardened pattern for secret lifecycle & rotation across multi-env (dev/staging/prod) using Secret Manager, CMEK, workload identity, and just-in-time ephemeral access.

**Pattern:**
1. Separate projects per env; CMEK keys per env (key ring).  
2. Secrets versioned; rotation Cloud Scheduler ‚Üí Cloud Run Job creates new version, validates canary retrieval, then promotes label `current`.  
3. Workload Identity (GKE / Cloud Run) grants minimal `secretAccessor` to specific secret only.  
4. Just-in-time ephemeral token service issues short-lived signed JWT enabling secret fetch for limited period.  
5. Access logs stream to BigQuery; anomaly detection on unusual pattern triggers forced rotation (disable old version).  
6. Replicate only non-prod sanitized secrets; production secrets isolated (no shared SAs).  
7. Alert if secret version age > rotation policy or if unreferenced secrets linger > TTL.

**Risk Scoring Modernization Architecture:**

```
Kafka (on-prem) ‚Üí Datastream / MirrorMaker ‚Üí Pub/Sub (ingest) ‚Üê App Events
       File Drops ‚Üí GCS Landing ‚Üí Dataflow File Ingest (batch micro-batch) ‚Üí Pub/Sub (normalized)

                                     ‚îÇ               ‚îî‚Üí Vertex AI Feature Store (online)
                                     ‚îÇ
                                     ‚îî‚Üí BigQuery Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold (audit lineage)
                                                 ‚îÇ            ‚îÇ
                                      Backfill Dataflow   Risk Score Recompute Job
                                                 ‚îÇ
                                      Vertex AI Prediction (online scoring API)
```

**Key Points:**
- Normalization layer produces canonical event envelope (schema-registry enforced).  
- Streaming aggregation updates incremental risk factors (velocity, recent anomalies).  
- Online scoring service (Cloud Run/GKE) pulls features from Feature Store + low-latency Bigtable (optional) for hot counters; responses cached (sub-second).  
- Replay: Bronze layer immutable + event timestamp partitioning; new scoring logic reprocess via versioned pipeline (Dataflow) writing alternative score column until verified.  
- Governance: Dataplex lineage, policy tags, signed scoring model metadata; reproducibility via model artifact hashing (Binary Authorization).  
- Resilience: Multi-region Pub/Sub topics; Dataflow jobs with drain/failover templates; scoring endpoints behind global LB with weighted region shift.  
- Cost: Tiered storage (Bronze short TTL to Nearline after 14d), selective feature retention, flex slots for burst transform windows.

**Automated Credential Compromise Response Pipeline:**

```
Secret Access Logs ‚Üí Log Sink (Pub/Sub) ‚Üí Cloud Function (Detector)
                                  ‚îÇ

                       Cloud Workflows (Response Orchestrator)
          ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
      Rotate Secret  Invalidate Tokens  Quarantine SA  Forensic Bundle
          ‚îÇ                 ‚îÇ                ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ
  Cloud Run Job ‚Üí New Version   IAM policy drop  Org Policy tag  Export logs + key history
```

**Detection Logic:**
- Features: access frequency delta, time-of-day deviation, geo/IP novelty, sequential enumeration of secret names, spike in denied attempts.
- If anomaly score > threshold & corroborated by second signal (e.g., IAM unusual SA impersonation), mark incident.

**Response Steps:**
1. Create new secret version; health check canary retrieval.  
2. Update label `current`; disable old version; notify dependent services via Pub/Sub.  
3. Force token revocation: revoke service account external access (disable key / remove binding).  
4. Quarantine: add deny condition IAM binding for compromised principal.  
5. Forensics: snapshot logs, export audit to GCS WORM bucket, hash manifest.  
6. Rollback: If downstream failure rate > threshold, re-enable prior version temporarily (flagged).  

**Safeguards:** Two-person approval (Access Approval) for destructive revocations except in auto-critical severity; backoff & retry on rotation errors; limit rotation bursts with rate controls.
