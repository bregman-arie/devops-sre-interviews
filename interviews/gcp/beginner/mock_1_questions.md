## 🧩 Section 3: Problem-Solving

**Task:**  
Design a basic GCP architecture for an e-commerce website that needs to handle the following requirements:
- **Frontend**: Static website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- **Backend API**: RESTful API to handle user requests
- **Database**: Store product information, user accounts, and orders
- **File Storage**: Product images and user uploads
- **Global Access**: Users from different geographic regions

Consider:
- Which GCP services would you use for each component?
- How would you ensure high availability and performance?
- What security measures would you implement?
- How would you handle traffic from different regions?
