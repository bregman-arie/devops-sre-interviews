## üß† Section 1: Core Questions - Answers

### 1. How does billing work in GCP? Explain the concepts of billing accounts, projects, and cost management tools.

**Answer:**

**GCP Billing Structure:**
- **Billing Account**: Payment method and billing contact information
- **Projects**: Resources are associated with projects, which are linked to billing accounts
- **Resource Usage**: Charges are based on actual resource consumption

**Billing Account Types:**
- **Self-serve**: Individual or small business accounts with credit card payment
- **Invoiced**: Enterprise accounts with monthly invoicing (requires approval)

**Cost Management Tools:**
- **Cloud Billing Console**: View and analyze spending
- **Budget Alerts**: Set spending thresholds with email/SMS notifications
- **Billing Export**: Export detailed billing data to BigQuery or Cloud Storage
- **Cost Breakdown**: View costs by service, project, location, or labels
- **Pricing Calculator**: Estimate costs before deployment
- **Committed Use Discounts**: Save money with 1-3 year commitments
- **Sustained Use Discounts**: Automatic discounts for consistent usage

**Best Practices:**
- Use labels to track costs by environment, team, or application
- Set up budget alerts at multiple thresholds (50%, 80%, 100%)
- Regularly review cost breakdowns and optimize unused resources

### 2. What is Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)? How does it differ from managing Kubernetes clusters manually?

**Answer:**

**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):**

### 3. Explain Cloud Pub/Sub and its use cases. How does it enable decoupled architectures?

**Answer:**

**Cloud Pub/Sub:**
- Fully managed messaging service for asynchronous communication

- Serverless and auto-scaling

**Key Components:**
- **Topic**: Named resource to which messages are sent
- **Subscription**: Named resource representing the stream of messages
- **Publisher**: Application that sends messages to a topic
- **Subscriber**: Application that receives messages from a subscription
- **Message**: Data payload with attributes

**How It Enables Decoupled Architectures:**
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services don't need to wait for responses
- **Scalability**: Publishers and subscribers scale independently

### 7. What are firewall rules in GCP? How do they control network traffic?

**Answer:**

**GCP Firewall Rules:**
- Virtual firewall rules that control traffic to and from VM instances

- Stateful connections (return traffic automatically allowed)

**Key Components:**

**Direction:**
- **Ingress**: Traffic coming into instances (inbound)
- **Egress**: Traffic leaving instances (outbound)

**Action:**
- **Allow**: Permit the traffic
- **Deny**: Block the traffic

**Targets (What instances are affected):**
- **All instances**: Apply to all VMs in the VPC
- **Specified targets**: Specific instances, tags, or service accounts
- **Target tags**: VMs with specific network tags

**Sources/Destinations:**
- **IP ranges**: Specific CIDR blocks (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 for all internet)
- **Source tags**: VMs with specific tags
- **Service accounts**: Traffic from/to specific service accounts

**Protocols and Ports:**
- **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, ICMP, or all
- **Ports**: Specific ports or port ranges

**Default Firewall Rules:**
- **default-allow-internal**: Allow traffic between VMs in same network
- **default-allow-ssh**: Allow SSH (port 22) from anywhere
- **default-allow-rdp**: Allow RDP (port 3389) from anywhere
- **default-allow-icmp**: Allow ICMP from anywhere

**Common Firewall Patterns:**

**Web Server (HTTP/HTTPS):**
```
Direction: Ingress
Action: Allow
Targets: Instances with tag "web-server"
Source IP ranges: 0.0.0.0/0
Protocols: TCP ports 80, 443
```

**Database Access (Internal only):**
```
Direction: Ingress
Action: Allow
Targets: Instances with tag "database"
Source tags: "app-server"
Protocols: TCP port 3306
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- **Deny by Default**: Only allow necessary traffic
- **Use Network Tags**: Organize instances with descriptive tags
- **Limit Source Ranges**: Avoid 0.0.0.0/0 when possible
- **Regular Review**: Audit and clean up unused rules
- **Hierarchical Rules**: Use implied deny for security
