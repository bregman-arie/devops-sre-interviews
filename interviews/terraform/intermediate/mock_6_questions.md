# Terraform Mock Interview #6 - Intermediate Level (Lifecycle & Protection Scenarios)

## Question 1: Protecting a Critical RDS Instance
**Scenario Question:** A teammate proposes adding `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` to an RDS instance after a near miss where a plan showed a replacement. Walk through how you evaluate whether to add it, implement it safely, and handle legitimate replacement needs later.

## Question 2: When `prevent_destroy` Causes Stalled Refactors
**Scenario Question:** You need to migrate an S3 bucket to a new naming standard but it is guarded by `prevent_destroy`. How do you proceed without breaking data access while respecting the guard?

## Question 3: Choosing Between `ignore_changes` and Data Model Fixes
**Scenario Question:** A security group keeps showing spurious diffs because AWS normalizes rule ordering. Should you use `ignore_changes` or restructure configuration? Detail decision criteria.

## Question 4: Using `create_before_destroy` for Zero-Downtime
**Scenario Question:** You must rotate an auto-scaling group launch template AMI with zero downtime. Explain how `create_before_destroy` works and risks if dependencies (e.g., unique names) aren't adjusted.

## Question 5: Auditing Lifecycle Usage
**Scenario Question:** Your repo has many lifecycle blocks. Design a lightweight audit process to ensure they are justified and not masking drift.

## Question 6: Removing `prevent_destroy` Safely
**Scenario Question:** You need to legitimately replace a protected VPC. Outline a safe procedure to temporarily remove the guard, migrate, and re-establish protection.

## Question 7: Policy Enforcement for Critical Resources
**Scenario Question:** How would you enforce (Sentinel/OPA) that certain resources must always have `prevent_destroy` applied unless an approved override label is present?

## Question 8: Anti-Patterns in Lifecycle Blocks
**Scenario Question:** List common anti-patterns with lifecycle usage (`prevent_destroy`, `ignore_changes`, `create_before_destroy`) and remediation steps.
