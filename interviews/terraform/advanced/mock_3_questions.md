# Terraform Mock Interview #3 - Advanced Level (Sensitive Variables & Secrets Management)

## Question 1: Core Approaches to Managing Sensitive Variables
**Question:** Enumerate the main strategies to manage sensitive variables (passwords, API keys) in Terraform. Compare using `sensitive = true` on variables, environment variables (`TF_VAR_*`), `.tfvars` files excluded from VCS, and external secret managers.

## Question 2: Preventing Secret Exposure in Plans and Logs
**Question:** How does Terraform attempt to mask sensitive values, and in what scenarios can secrets still leak? Detail mitigations for CI/CD pipelines.

## Question 3: Integrating with HashiCorp Vault
**Question:** Show a pattern for retrieving dynamic database credentials from Vault for use in Terraform-managed infrastructure without writing the password to state permanently.

## Question 7: Policy as Code for Secret Usage
**Question:** How would you enforce that no hardcoded secrets appear in Terraform code using Sentinel/OPA or static analysis? Provide a high-level policy example.

## Question 8: Secure Variable Injection in CI/CD
**Question:** Design a pipeline stage to inject secrets into Terraform runs securely. Cover vault authentication, ephemeral tokens, masking, and artifact handling.
