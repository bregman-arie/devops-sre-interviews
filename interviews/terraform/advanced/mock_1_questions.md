# Terraform Mock Interview #1 - Advanced Level

## Question 1: Multi-Environment Infrastructure with Custom Modules

**Practical Scenario:** You need to design a Terraform solution for a microservices application that deploys to dev, staging, and production environments. Each environment has different scaling requirements, security policies, and resource configurations.

**Task:** Create a module structure and show how you would:
- Handle environment-specific configurations (instance counts, sizes, security groups)
- Implement proper naming conventions and tagging strategies
- Manage secrets and sensitive data across environments
- Ensure consistent networking but environment-specific subnets

Provide actual code examples for the module structure and usage.

## Question 2: State Management and Team Collaboration Anti-Patterns

**Practical Scenario:** Your team is experiencing frequent state lock conflicts, occasional state corruption, and developers accidentally applying changes to the wrong environment. You've been tasked with redesigning the state management strategy.

**Task:** Design and implement:
- A robust remote state backend configuration with proper locking
- State isolation strategy for multiple teams and environments
- CI/CD pipeline integration that prevents common state issues
- Recovery procedures for state corruption scenarios

Show the actual backend configurations and pipeline code.

## Question 3: Complex Resource Dependencies and Data Flow

**Practical Scenario:** You're building infrastructure where an EKS cluster needs to be created first, then specific node groups with custom AMIs, followed by application deployments that require cluster information, and finally DNS records that depend on load balancer endpoints.

**Task:** Implement this complex dependency chain:
- Show how to properly sequence resource creation
- Handle cross-module dependencies
- Implement proper error handling for failed dependencies
- Demonstrate how to pass data between different parts of the infrastructure

Provide working Terraform code with proper dependency management.

## Question 4: Dynamic Infrastructure Based on External Data

**Practical Scenario:** Your infrastructure needs to dynamically create resources based on data from external systems - a CMDB API that returns a list of applications with their specific requirements (CPU, memory, storage, compliance requirements).

**Task:** Create a solution that:
- Fetches data from an external API or data source
- Dynamically creates resources based on this data
- Handles changes in the external data source
- Implements proper validation and error handling

Show actual code for data fetching, processing, and resource creation.

## Question 5: Custom Provider Development and Integration

**Practical Scenario:** Your organization uses a proprietary system for managing network configurations that doesn't have an existing Terraform provider. You need to integrate this system with your Terraform workflows.

**Task:** Design an integration approach:
- Create a custom Terraform provider or use external providers
- Implement CRUD operations for your custom resources
- Handle provider authentication and error scenarios
- Show how to test and validate the custom provider

Provide code examples and integration patterns.

## Question 6: Performance Optimization for Large-Scale Infrastructure

**Practical Scenario:** Your Terraform configuration manages 500+ AWS accounts with thousands of resources per account. Planning takes 45+ minutes and applies frequently fail due to timeouts and API limits.

**Task:** Implement optimization strategies:
- Restructure configurations for better performance
- Implement parallel execution patterns
- Handle API rate limiting and timeouts
- Design a strategy for incremental deployments

Show specific configuration changes and architectural decisions.

## Question 7: Disaster Recovery and Infrastructure Automation

**Practical Scenario:** You need to implement a disaster recovery strategy where infrastructure can be rebuilt in a different region within 30 minutes, maintaining data consistency and minimizing downtime.

**Task:** Design and implement:
- Cross-region state and resource replication
- Automated failover procedures using Terraform
- Data backup and restoration workflows
- Infrastructure validation and testing procedures

Provide actual automation scripts and Terraform configurations.

## Question 8: Security Compliance and Policy Enforcement

**Practical Scenario:** Your infrastructure must comply with SOC2 and PCI-DSS requirements. All resources must be validated against security policies before deployment, and you need audit trails for all changes.

**Task:** Implement a security-first approach:
- Create policy-as-code validation using OPA/Sentinel
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Design audit logging and compliance reporting
- Show how to handle security violations and rollbacks

Provide working policy code and enforcement mechanisms.

## Question 9: Advanced Testing and Validation Strategies

**Practical Scenario:** Your team needs comprehensive testing for Terraform modules and configurations, including unit tests, integration tests, and compliance validation before production deployment.

**Task:** Implement a complete testing strategy:
- Unit tests for individual modules using Terratest or similar
- Integration tests for complete environments
- Policy validation and compliance testing
- Performance and cost optimization validation

Show actual test code and CI/CD integration.

## Question 10: Real-World Debugging and Incident Response

**Practical Scenario:** At 2 AM, your production Terraform apply fails halfway through a critical deployment, leaving infrastructure in an inconsistent state. Some resources are created, others failed, and the application is partially down.

**Task:** Walk through your incident response:
- Immediate assessment and damage control procedures
- State analysis and recovery strategies
- How to safely resume or rollback the deployment
- Post-incident analysis and prevention measures

Provide actual commands, scripts, and procedures you would follow.
