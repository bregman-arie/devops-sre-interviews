# Terraform Mock Interview #3 - Beginner Level (Core Language Constructs)

## Question 1: Variables vs Locals vs Outputs
**Question:** What are the differences between Terraform variables, local values (`locals`), and outputs? Provide use cases, lifecycle, visibility, and examples showing how they interact in a module.

## Question 2: Input Variable Types and Validation
**Question:** Show examples of declaring string, number, map, object, and list variables with validation rules. When should you use validation vs. descriptive documentation only?

---

## Question 3: Default Values and Overriding
**Question:** How are variable defaults overridden using CLI flags, environment variables, and `.tfvars` files? Which order of precedence applies?

---

## Question 4: Organizing Variables and Outputs in Modules
**Question:** Provide a recommended file layout for a reusable module with variables, locals, resources, and outputs. Explain why separation aids readability.

## Question 5: Sensitive Outputs
**Question:** How do you mark outputs as sensitive? What effect does that have in CLI output and downstream modules?
[ðŸ“– Answer](mock_3_answers.md#question-5-sensitive-outputs)

---

## Question 6: Passing Module Outputs Between Modules
**Question:** Show an example of chaining module outputs from a network module into an application module. What happens if the output changes type?

---

## Question 7: Using Locals for DRY Patterns
**Question:** Provide 3 examples where locals reduce duplication (naming convention, common tags, computed lists). Why not turn every repeated value into a local?
[ðŸ“– Answer](mock_3_answers.md#question-7-using-locals-for-dry-patterns)

---

## Question 8: Refactoring Variables into Locals
**Question:** When should something start as a variable and later become a local (or vice versa)? Describe refactoring signals.
[ðŸ“– Answer](mock_3_answers.md#question-8-refactoring-variables-into-locals)

---

## Question 9: Output Consumption in Root Module
**Question:** How do you reference output values after `terraform apply` for scripting or integration? Provide both CLI and automation examples.
[ðŸ“– Answer](mock_3_answers.md#question-9-output-consumption-in-root-module)

---

## Question 10: Common Pitfalls
**Question:** List common mistakes with variables, locals, and outputs (e.g., circular local references, overexposed outputs, ignoring sensitive marking) and fixes.
