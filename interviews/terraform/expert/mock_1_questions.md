## ðŸ§  Section 1: Core Questions

1. **Terraform Core Architecture Deep Dive**: Explain the internal architecture of Terraform Core including the resource graph construction, dependency resolution algorithms, and the role of the RPC protocol in provider communication. How does Terraform handle circular dependencies and what are the performance implications of large resource graphs? [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#1-terraform-core-architecture-deep-dive)

2. **Advanced State Management & Concurrency**: Design a state management strategy for a large enterprise with 500+ engineers, multiple cloud providers, and thousands of resources. Address state locking mechanisms, concurrent operations, state drift detection, and implement a custom state backend with encryption at rest and in transit. Include disaster recovery procedures. [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#2-advanced-state-management--concurrency)

3. **Custom Provider Development**: Implement a custom Terraform provider from scratch using the Plugin Framework v6. Include CRUD operations, complex nested schemas, plan modifiers, validators, and proper error handling. Explain the provider protocol evolution from v4 to v6 and the benefits of each approach. [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#3-custom-provider-development)

4. **Enterprise Module Ecosystem & Governance**: Architect a module ecosystem for a Fortune 500 company with compliance requirements (SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS). Design module versioning strategies, implement automated testing pipelines, policy as code integration (OPA/Sentinel), and cross-team collaboration workflows. [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#4-enterprise-module-ecosystem--governance)

5. **Advanced Resource Lifecycle Management**: Explain the complete resource lifecycle in Terraform including create_before_destroy behavior, replace_triggered_by, lifecycle rules, and import workflows. Design a zero-downtime migration strategy for a critical production database from one provider to another. [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#5-advanced-resource-lifecycle-management)

6. **Terraform Cloud & Enterprise Architecture**: Design a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise deployment for a multi-region, multi-cloud organization. Include workspace organization, VCS integration patterns, policy sets, cost estimation integration, and private module registry design. Address security, compliance, and disaster recovery. [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#6-terraform-cloud--enterprise-architecture)

7. **Performance Optimization & Scalability**: Optimize Terraform performance for managing 10,000+ resources across multiple providers. Address parallelism tuning, provider caching, partial operations, state splitting strategies, and memory optimization. Include monitoring and observability patterns. [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#7-performance-optimization--scalability)

8. **Infrastructure Security & Compliance Integration**: Implement a comprehensive security framework using Terraform with policy as code, secret management, RBAC, infrastructure scanning, and compliance reporting. Integrate with external security tools and implement continuous compliance monitoring. [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#8-infrastructure-security--compliance-integration)

## ðŸš€ Section 2: Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery
You're architecting a disaster recovery solution that spans AWS, Azure, and GCP. The solution must maintain identical infrastructure across all three clouds with automated failover capabilities.

**Requirements:**
- Cross-cloud state synchronization
- Provider-agnostic resource definitions
- Automated failover triggers
- Data replication strategies
- Network connectivity between clouds

**Challenge:** Implement the Terraform configuration with proper abstractions, error handling, and automation. [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#scenario-1-multi-cloud-disaster-recovery)

### Scenario 2: Terraform State Surgery
Your production Terraform state has become corrupted due to a failed migration. The state contains 2000+ resources across 15 modules, and manual recovery is required to avoid recreating critical infrastructure.

**Situation:**
- State file shows resources that no longer exist in reality
- Some resources exist in cloud but not in state
- Resource addresses have changed due to refactoring
- Import operations are failing for complex resources

**Challenge:** Design and execute a state recovery plan with minimal service disruption. [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#scenario-2-terraform-state-surgery)

### Scenario 3: Custom Provider for Legacy API
You need to create a Terraform provider for a legacy SOAP-based API that manages network appliances. The API has inconsistent behavior, poor documentation, and complex authentication.

**Constraints:**
- SOAP-only interface (no REST)
- Session-based authentication with timeouts
- Eventual consistency (changes take 5-10 minutes to propagate)
- Limited API calls per hour
- Complex nested resource dependencies

**Challenge:** Design and implement a robust provider that handles all edge cases. [ðŸ“– Answer](mock_1_answers.md#scenario-3-custom-provider-for-legacy-api)

## ðŸ”§ Section 3: Advanced Technical Questions

### Question A: Terraform Graph Theory
Explain how Terraform constructs and optimizes the dependency graph. What algorithms are used for topological sorting, and how does Terraform detect and resolve cycles? Discuss the impact of graph complexity on performance and memory usage.

### Question B: Provider Plugin Architecture
Detail the Terraform provider plugin architecture including the gRPC communication protocol, schema definitions, and the provider SDK internals. How do you handle provider crashes, timeouts, and version compatibility?

### Question C: State Locking Mechanisms
Compare different state locking mechanisms (DynamoDB, Consul, PostgreSQL, Azure Blob) in terms of performance, reliability, and consistency guarantees. Design a custom locking mechanism for a high-frequency CI/CD environment.

### Question D: Terraform Internals & Extensibility
Explain Terraform's core execution phases (init, validate, plan, apply, destroy) at the code level. How would you extend Terraform Core with custom functionality without modifying the source code?
