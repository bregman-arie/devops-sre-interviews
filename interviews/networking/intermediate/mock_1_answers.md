**Answer:**
**BGP** is the protocol that makes the internet work by enabling routing between different autonomous systems (AS).

**Key characteristics:**
- **Path-vector protocol**: Makes routing decisions based on path, network policies, and rule sets
- **Inter-AS routing**: Routes traffic between different organizations/ISPs
- **Policy-based**: Allows complex routing policies for business relationships
- **Scalable**: Handles hundreds of thousands of routes

**BGP types:**
- **eBGP (External BGP)**: Between different autonomous systems
- **iBGP (Internal BGP)**: Within the same autonomous system

**Use cases:**
- ISP routing decisions
- Multi-homed networks
- Traffic engineering
- Route filtering and manipulation

### 2. What is VLAN and how does it work? What are the benefits?

**Answer:**
**VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)** creates logical network segments within a physical network infrastructure.

**How VLANs work:**
- **VLAN tagging**: 802.1Q standard adds 4-byte tag to Ethernet frames
- **Switch configuration**: Ports assigned to specific VLANs
- **Trunk ports**: Carry traffic for multiple VLANs
- **Access ports**: Belong to single VLAN

**Benefits:**
- **Broadcast domain separation**: Reduces broadcast traffic
- **Security**: Isolates sensitive traffic
- **Flexibility**: Easy to move users without rewiring
- **Performance**: Reduces congestion
- **Cost savings**: Reduces need for physical switches
- **Simplified management**: Logical grouping of devices

**VLAN types:**

### 3. Describe the difference between OSPF and RIP routing protocols.

**Answer:**

| Feature | OSPF | RIP |
|---------|------|-----|
| **Type** | Link-state | Distance-vector |
| **Metric** | Cost (bandwidth-based) | Hop count |
| **Max hops** | No limit | 15 hops |
| **Convergence** | Fast | Slow |
| **Scalability** | High | Low |
| **CPU usage** | Higher | Lower |
| **Memory usage** | Higher | Lower |
| **VLSM support** | Yes | RIPv2 only |
| **Authentication** | Yes | RIPv2 only |

**OSPF advantages:**

### 4. What is MPLS and why is it used in enterprise networks?

**Answer:**
**MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)** is a high-performance method for forwarding packets through a network using labels instead of IP addresses.

**How MPLS works:**
- **Label assignment**: Each packet gets a label
- **Label switching**: Routers forward based on labels, not IP
- **Label removal**: Exit router removes label

**Benefits:**
- **Performance**: Faster forwarding decisions
- **Traffic engineering**: Control traffic paths
- **VPN services**: MPLS L3VPN for secure connectivity
- **QoS**: Guaranteed service levels
- **Simplified routing**: Reduced routing table lookups

**Use cases:**
- **WAN connectivity**: Connecting branch offices
- **Service provider networks**: ISP backbone infrastructure
- **Enterprise VPNs**: Secure inter-site communication
- **Voice/video**: Guaranteed bandwidth and low latency

### 5. Explain STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) and why it's necessary.

**Answer:**
**STP** prevents loops in switched networks by blocking redundant paths while maintaining backup connectivity.

**Why STP is necessary:**
- **Broadcast storms**: Loops cause infinite broadcast propagation
- **MAC table instability**: Constantly changing MAC address tables
- **Multiple frame copies**: Same frame arrives multiple times

**How STP works:**
1. **Root bridge election**: Lowest bridge ID becomes root
2. **Path calculation**: Determine shortest path to root
3. **Port states**: Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding
4. **BPDU exchange**: Bridge Protocol Data Units share information

**STP variants:**
- **STP (802.1D)**: Original, slow convergence (30-50 seconds)
- **RSTP (802.1w)**: Rapid convergence (1-3 seconds)
- **MSTP (802.1s)**: Multiple spanning trees for VLANs

- **Remote mirroring**: Source and destination on different switches
- **Flow-based mirroring**: Mirrors specific traffic flows

**When to use port mirroring:**
