## 🧠 Section 1: Core Questions

1. Design a multi-cloud global anycast edge delivering <50ms P99 latency to 95% of users; discuss route optimization, BGP policies, and failover.  
2. Explain strategies for mitigating east-west lateral movement and enforcing zero trust in a hybrid data center + cloud environment.  
3. Compare load balancing layers (L4 vs L7 vs Global vs Local) and decision factors for combining them.  
4. Outline packet-level troubleshooting workflow for intermittent high tail latency between two services.  
5. Discuss techniques for reducing TLS handshake overhead at scale (session resumption, ALPN, QUIC).  
6. Architect DDoS resilience for volumetric + application layer attacks with adaptive controls.  
7. Describe implementation of traffic shadowing for a new service version without user impact.  
8. What telemetry do you collect to feed autonomous traffic shaping (signals + decision loop)?
