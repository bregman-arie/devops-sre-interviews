## ‚öôÔ∏è Section 2: Scenario

**Scenario:**  
Your company is migrating to a multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster where different teams (frontend, backend, data) need isolated environments. Security is a major concern - teams should not be able to access each other's resources or network traffic. Additionally, you need to implement proper monitoring and ensure compliance with organizational security policies.  

Design a comprehensive security and governance strategy that includes:
- Network isolation between teams
- RBAC configuration for different user roles  
- Resource access controls and quotas
- Security scanning and policy enforcement
- Monitoring and audit logging

## üß© Section 3: Problem-Solving

**Task:**  
A team reports that their application pods cannot communicate with the database service, but the database pods are running fine. The infrastructure uses a service mesh (Istio) and has strict network policies in place. You've been asked to troubleshoot and fix the connectivity issue.

**Current Configuration:**

```yaml
# Database Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: postgres-db
  namespace: database
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: postgres
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: postgres
        image: postgres:13
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5432
        env:
        - name: POSTGRES_DB
          value: appdb
        - name: POSTGRES_USER
          value: dbuser
        - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
          value: dbpass

# Database Service  
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: postgres-service
  namespace: database
spec:
  selector:
    app: postgres
  ports:
  - port: 5432
    targetPort: 5432
  type: ClusterIP

---
# Application Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
  namespace: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
        env:
        - name: DB_HOST
          value: postgres-service.database.svc.cluster.local
        - name: DB_PORT
          value: "5432"

# Network Policy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: database-policy
  namespace: database
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: backend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
```

**Reported Issues:**
1. Web application cannot connect to database
2. Connection timeouts when trying to reach postgres-service
3. Istio sidecar injection is enabled for both namespaces
4. Network policies are blocking unexpected traffic

Identify the connectivity problems and provide a corrected configuration with proper security controls.
