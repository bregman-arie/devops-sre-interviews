## (Optional) Interviewer Prompts

Use these nudges if the candidate stalls:
- How would you distinguish client-side vs server-side stall?  
- What kube-proxy mode considerations or node-local DNS behaviors matter?  
- How do TCP vs HTTP-layer timeouts interplay here?  
- Can connection reuse or keepalive settings contribute?  
- What ingress annotations could create uneven behavior?
